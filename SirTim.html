    <h1 class="w3-xxxlarge w3-text-red"><b>Our Lord, Sir Tim-Berners Lee!</b></h1>
    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>It was, Sir Tim-Berners Lee, the child of two early computer scientists who invented the WWW in an effort to make communication between scientists working on the CERN particle physics laboratory far easier. So he simply took the already fast developing internet and invented a communication protocol, that way where they could all understand each other through hyper text.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There are 3 things that Sir Tim-Berners Lee has to invent to make the WWW work, HTML, HTTP and URI. HTML, is the actual language that websites are written in and are the files that are read by the Web Browser. HTTP is the protocol between the different devices that allows all this to happen. And the URI/URL is the address that is unique and used to identify each resource on the web.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Well the impact of the decentralized and royalty free design of the WWW were monumental as these things essentially made it possible for anything to exist and to almost immediately have a sizable audience at hand. This allowed for the creation and growth of literally tens of thousands of companies, from “Reddit”, to “FaceBook” to “Google”. Which all began as small projects from individuals, and thats what the internet is all about, individuals.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="container" style="display:flex;justify-content:center;align-items:center;">
      <p>Here are some of the principles behind the internet; (this was acquired from <a href="https://webfoundation.org/about/vision/history-of-the-web/"> here!</a> );</p>

                <li class="w3-dark-grey w3-xlarge w3-padding-32">Principles of the Internet</li>
                <li class="w3-padding-16"><h3>Decentralisation</h3><p>No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure … and no “kill switch”! This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.</p></li>
                <li class="w3-padding-16"><h3>Non-discrimination</h3><p>If I pay to connect to the internet with a certain quality of service, and you pay to connect with that or a greater quality of service, then we can both communicate at the same level. This principle of equity is also known as Net Neutrality.</p></li>
                <li class="w3-padding-16"><h3>Bottom-up design</h3><p>Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.</p></li>
                <li class="w3-padding-16"><h3>Universality</h3><p>For anyone to be able to publish anything on the web, all the computers involved have to speak the same languages to each other, no matter what different hardware people are using; where they live; or what cultural and political beliefs they have. In this way, the web breaks down silos while still allowing diversity to flourish.</p></li>
                <li class="w3-padding-16"><h3>Consensus</h3><p>For universal standards to work, everyone had to agree to use them. Tim and others achieved this consensus by giving everyone a say in creating the standards, through a transparent, participatory process at W3C.</p></li>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h3>Serial Data Transmission</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Serial Transmission is the transmission of data one bit at a time. The device willt ake the information and serialise it, turning it into  seperate bits and transmitting them one at a time.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Parallel Data Transmission</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Parallel Data Transmission is the same as Serial Transmission, except instead of only have one lane, you can have as many as you want, this is mostly use for transmission of large files over a short distance, and is used mostly directly through the motherboard for things such as RAM, the CPU, or the GPU which all require fast real time transmission of data.</p>

    <br>

    <p>Below is a table that simplistically compares the two forms of data transmission over a wire, with both their positives and their negatives.</p>

    <div class="w3-row-padding">
      <div class="w3-half w3-margin-bottom">

          <li class="w3-padding-16">The most common form of data transmission and by far the best for transmitting data over long distances.</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Uses a single wire, far reduced cost compared to parralell</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Slower than parallel over short distances.</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Easier to check the recived packet as it arries all at once. Therefor serieal data transmission is far more reliable.<br></br></li>

        <ul class="w3-ul w3-light-grey w3-center">
          <li class="w3-red w3-xlarge w3-padding-32">Parallel Data Transmission</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Faster data transmission as each bit is sent over a different wire.</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Requires far more resources and this increases cost and practicality.</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Should only be used over very short distances.</li>
          <li class="w3-padding-16">Very vulnerable to signal interference, especially over long distances. Checking all the bits have arrives on reciever's side is inefficient.<br></br></li>

  <!-- All the Plexs' -->

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <h3>Simplex</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Simplex uses only one lane of communication between two devices. A common analogy is a one-way road, where cars can go one way, but not the other, in the real world, the most common use of Simplex is with a mouse and a keyboard, where most of the time, a mouse or a keyboard will need to send information ot the CPU but not the other way round, hence no need for anything more than duplex.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Full - Duplex</h3>
    <br>
    <p>Following the analogy with roads, a Full-Duplex is your regular 2 lane highway, where inforamtion and cars can be sent either way without an issues, this is the most common of the 3 data transmission systems as most devices need to talk to each other to work eifficiently and properly. For example with netowrking, your computer will have a Full-Duplex connection to the server, as your computer needs to send information to the server and vice-versa.</p>
    <br></br>
    <h3>Half - Duplex</h3>
    <br>
    <p>For our final road analogy, the Half-Duplex is like your tunnel road, where traffic can only pass through in one direction at a time. There are so few examples of this that it's almost pointless to learn about. However it is more cost advantage compared to a Full-Duplex but also half as slow.</p>

    <hr style="width:50px;border:5px solid red" class="w3-round">
    <p>We can connect 2 computers to each other fairly easily, by using an ethernet cable or wirelessly with WIFI or Bluetooth. But we could connect more, however there reaches a point where it would be far simple to use a “router”. A router simply has a direct connection to each computer and directs a message from one computer to the next. Say we had 3 computers in our network, A, B and C, if C sent a message to A, the router would take the message from C and send it to A. Easy as. </p>
    <br>
    <p>But lets plug one router into the next, now we’ve got a much larger network of computers, then we could just keep connecting router to router however this is only a personal network it doesn’t connect to anything else. So what already in place infrastructure could we use to connect to the rest of the world? </p>
    <br>
    <p>Why the telephone cables of course. This is where the “modem” comes into play. A modem turns the information from our network into information manageable by the telephone infrastructure and vice versa. So now we’re connected to the telephone infrastructure. The next step is to send the messages from our network to the network we want to reach. To do that, we will connect our network to an Internet Service Provider.</p>
    <br>
    <p> An ISP is a company that manages some special routers that link all together and can also access other ISPs' routers. So the message from our network is carried through the network of ISP networks to the destination network. The Internet consists of this whole infrastructure of networks. By the end, it looks something like this;</p>
